We made JSHint\nvery flexible so you can easily adjust it to your particular coding guidelines\nand the environment you expect your code to execute in.\n\nOur goal is to help JavaScript developers write complex programs without\nworrying about typos and language gotchas.\n\nWe believe that static code analysis programs—as well as other code quality\ntools—are important and beneficial to the JavaScript community and, thus,\nshould not alienate their users.\n\nFor general usage and hacking information, visit our website:\n[http://jshint.com/](http://jshint.com/).\n\nBug Bounties\n--------------------------------\n\nSome bugs are so important to us, we will pay you if you fix them! Go to\n[our page on BountySource](https://www.bountysource.com/#trackers/48759-jshint)\nto see which bugs have bounties behind them.\n\nReally want to have something fixed but don't have time? You can add your\nown bounty to any JSHint bug and make it more attractive for potential\ncontributors!\n\n**Rule:** A bug is considered fixed only after it has been merged into the\nmaster branch of the main JSHint repository.\n\nReporting a bug\n---------------\n\nTo report a bug simply create a\n[new GitHub Issue](https://github.com/jshint/jshint/issues/new) and describe\nyour problem or suggestion. We welcome all kind of feedback regarding\nJSHint including but not limited to:\n\n * When JSHint doesn't work as expected\n * When JSHint complains about valid JavaScript code that works in all browsers\n * When you simply want a new option or feature\n\nBefore reporting a bug look around to see if there are any open or closed tickets\nthat cover your issue. And remember the wisdom: pull request > bug report > tweet.\n\n\nFAQ\n---\n\n#### How do I turn off \"mixed tabs and spaces\" warning?\n\nIf you're using so-called [smart tabs](http://www.emacswiki.org/SmartTabs)\nthen we have an option `smarttabs` for you. Otherwise, your solution is to\nrun JSHint with a custom reporter that discards any warnings you don't like.\nFor example, this [example reporter](https://gist.github.com/3885619)\ndiscards all warnings about mixed tabs and spaces.\n\nContributing\n------------\n\nLook for a file named `CONTRIBUTING.md` in this repository.
